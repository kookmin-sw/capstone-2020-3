Hey wassup my name in Junho Yoon
And I hope this works well to our project.
Command-line usage
The wordcloud_cli tool can be used to generate word clouds directly from the command-line:

$ wordcloud_cli --text mytext.txt --imagefile wordcloud.png
If you're dealing with PDF files, then pdftotext, included by default with many Linux distribution, comes in handy:

$ pdftotext mydocument.pdf - | wordcloud_cli --imagefile wordcloud.png
In the previous example, the - argument orders pdftotext to write the resulting text to stdout, which is then piped to the stdin of wordcloud_cli.py.

Use wordcloud_cli --help so see all available options.

Licensing
The wordcloud library is MIT licenced, but contains DroidSansMono.ttf, a true type font by Google, that is apache licensed. The font is by no means integral, and any other font can be used by setting the font_path variable when creating a WordCloud object.
